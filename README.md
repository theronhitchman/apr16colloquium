#### Bridge Numbers: A Knotty Journey

### Abstract

A _knot_ is (an ambient isotopy class of) an embedding of the circle in space. Uh...

A mathematician’s knot is what you get when you tie a string into some regular
knot, and then fuse the loose ends together seamlessly.
(It’s not magic. It’s Math!) Knots are fun to draw, but can we make a best
drawing? We will discuss how to find a drawing of a knot that has the least
number of “overpass arcs” called bridges. The smallest number of bridges needed
to draw a knot is called its bridge index. We will share our algorithm for
visually computing the bridge index of a knot, and the results of using this
algorithm to work on the bridge indices for prime knots with 12 crossings.
There are over 2000 such knots, so we probably won’t get to them all.

Students are encouraged to attend. No background is necessary beyond having
played with string at some point in your life.
